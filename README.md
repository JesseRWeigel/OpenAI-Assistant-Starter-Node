# OpenAI Assistant in Node.js

This project is a Node.js application that interfaces with the OpenAI API to create an interactive assistant. It showcases how to create an assistant, manage conversation threads, and process user messages to generate responses using OpenAI's powerful models.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JesseRWeigel/OpenAI-Assistant-Starter-Node.git
cd OpenAI-Assistant-Starter-Node
yarn
```

Make sure to create a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following content:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

## Usage

To run the assistant, use the following command:

```bash
yarn start
```

The assistant will engage in a conversation flow as defined in the `index.js` file, providing a math tutoring service.
